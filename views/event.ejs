                      The event .Bytes was successfully organized by the DevOps Team during the odd semester on the 3rd
                      and 4th of November 2017. The event truly embodied the tagline, "Where Technology Meets Fun," as
                      it creatively blended technical challenges with engaging activities, making technology both
                      accessible and enjoyable for all participants
                      The event offered the team members valuable hands-on experience with software tools essential for
                      application development, greatly enhancing their technical expertise. This not only inspired the
                      students of MCE but also fostered a culture of innovation and creativity on campus.
                      Two standout events, Thief City and Phat Anthaheli, were major highlights of .Bytes. Thief City
                      challenged participants with puzzles and problem-solving tasks rooted in coding and logic, while
                      Phat Anthaheli brought a playful, competitive edge, pushing participants to think outside the box
                      and apply their technical knowledge in novel ways. The success of .Bytes demonstrated the power of
                      combining learning with fun, leaving a lasting impact on everyone involved and setting a high
                      standard for future events
